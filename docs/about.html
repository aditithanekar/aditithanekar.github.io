    <h1>About Aditi Thanekar</h1>
    <div class="about-page">
    <div class="about-container">
        <p>I am a 15-year-old artist and creator. I love to bring positivity to people through the things that I make. With a smile, it sparks joy and makes the efforts and hard work worth it. I also play percussion instruments, as well as arrange music.</p>
        <p> I enjoy using diverse art forms like paint, 3D sculpture with clay, vector graphics and animation! In this COVID-19 pandemic, I have been sewing to make masks for my family and others. Currently working on learning new things as well as coding languages! Learning from experience, and debugging is like finding a rainbow hidden behind the clouds on a gloomy day. It is one of the largest motivators for my work and perseverance! Find something joyful to keep you going! :) </p>
